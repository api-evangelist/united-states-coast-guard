  The United States Coast Guard is a branch of the military responsible for
  enforcing maritime laws, protecting the nation's waterways and coastlines, and
  ensuring the safety and security of seafarers. They conduct search and rescue
  operations, respond to environmental disasters, combat illegal drug
  trafficking and immigration, and conduct security patrols to thwart terrorism
  threats. The Coast Guard also plays a crucial role in maintaining navigational
  aids, regulating maritime commerce, and conducting icebreaking operations in
  the polar regions. In addition to their law enforcement and military duties,
  the Coast Guard also serves as a humanitarian organization, providing disaster
  relief and humanitarian assistance both domestically and internationally.
